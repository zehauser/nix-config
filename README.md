# README

This is my personal nix-config repo. I continue to have fun and learn more about Linux internals, system administration, and many computer things that I didn't know much about before via the gateway drugs of NixOS and Tailscale. I've recently added in nix-darwin and home-manager to the mix, so now I find myself tweaking aspects my Nix config increasingly often.

This repo isn't intended to be general-purpose, or directly useful to others, so please have low expectations. That said, I have recently learned many helpful things from many people's Nix repos, and so I decided to make this repo public on the off chance that it might in turn be helpful, or at least interesting, to any deeply lost travellers (or rather, Github Search spelunkers) who stumble into it.

I probably won't push updates here every time I make a tweak or try an experiment, but I intend to keep it semi-up-to-date. Hopefully this will encourage me to maintain a better-written config.
