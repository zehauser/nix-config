# README

This is a public mirror of my personal nix-config repo. 

It's not intended to be general-purpose or directly useful to others, so please have low expectations. However, I've learned a lot from other people's Nix configs, and so I wanted to make this public on the off chance that it might in turn be helpful, or at least interesting, to any deeply lost travellers (or rather, Github Search spelunkers) who stumble into it.

I probably won't push updates here every time I make a tweak or try an experiment, but I hope to keep it vaguely up-to-date. And perhaps the (theoretical) public eye will encourage me to maintain a better-written config.
